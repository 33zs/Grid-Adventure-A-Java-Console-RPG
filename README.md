# Grid Adventure - Java RPG Game 🎮

> A simple text-based 2D Role-Playing Game (RPG) implemented in Java, based on object-oriented principles.

## 📌 Introduction

**Grid Adventure** is a console-based Java RPG game where the player navigates a grid world, encounters monsters, and engages in strategic combat. The project was developed as a coursework assignment to demonstrate mastery of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts including **abstraction**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **encapsulation**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Apply OOP principles in a real-world context
- Build a playable turn-based game with interactive elements
- Enable player movement, monster AI, and combat logic
- Explore game lifecycle design using Java class structures

## 🕹️ Game Mechanics

- The player is placed on a 2D grid map.
- Monsters move randomly each round.
- The player can move in four directions and engage in combat.
- The game ends when all monsters are defeated or the player dies.

## 💻 Development Environment

- Language: Java 17+
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VSCode
- No external libraries required (pure Java)
